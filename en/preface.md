# Preface

The Wa-lang is a general statically typed compiled language designed for the WebAssembly platform. It is a project initiated by a group of programming language enthusiasts in China, and its design focuses on reducing the mental burden on users.

The project was established at the end of 2018, and preliminary preparations began in 2019. New members will be added in 2020. In 2021, the project co-founders publish a book [《Go语言定制指南》("Go Language Customization Guide")](https://github.com/chai2010/go-ast-book), the project was officially launched in 2022 and open sourced on July 20. Wa-lang is taking one step at a time. Among similar projects in China, it is the first to accomplish compilation and execution in web page.

On the first anniversary of open source, Wa-lang released [MVP version](https://github.com/wa-lang/wa/releases) on August 12 (MVP means "Minimum Viable Product"). We hope that the release of the MVP version will allow everyone to try and explore more and imagine more possibilities for future development.

Finally, thanks to the support of Chinese programming language enthusiasts, the Wa-lang MVP version is a new starting point. Everyone is welcome to participate in the co-construction!
